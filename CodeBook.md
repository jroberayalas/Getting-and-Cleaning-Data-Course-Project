Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is
to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This repo contains 3 files:

1. A markdown README.md
2. An R script run_analysis.R
3. A markdown CodeBook.md
