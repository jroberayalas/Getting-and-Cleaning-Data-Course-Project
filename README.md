Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

## README

The **purpose** of this project is to demonstrate my ability to **collect**, **work with**, and **clean** a data set. The **goal** is to prepare **tidy data** that can be used for later analysis.

The data used for this project was downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
on Mon Sep 15 16:34:35 2014.

This repo contains 4 files:

1. A markdown **README.md** - contains general information about the project
2. An R script **run_analysis.R** - the script used to collect and clean the data set
3. A markdown **CodeBook.md** - describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data
4. A text file **tidyDataSet.txt** - the tidy data set created

The data was saved on its own directory called "Data", and read using the R script run_analysis.R
