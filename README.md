Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is
to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This repo contains 3 files:

1. A markdown README.md
2. An R script run_analysis.R
3. A markdown CodeBook.md

The data used for this project was downloaded from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
on Mon Sep 15 16:34:35 2014.

The data was saved on its own directory and read using the R script run_analysis.R
